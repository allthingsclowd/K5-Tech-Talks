Quick repo to distribute some files to demo K5 api calls based on Python 2.7

Script 1 : Build Server - will build a single server, network and router using just API calls

Script 2 : Build Server with floating ip - will build X number of Ubuntu P-1 servers and make one of them a jump server with floating ip.

ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING IS CREATED FOR YOU - Security Groups, SSH Keys, Networks, Subnets, Routers and Servers

Script 3 : VPNaaSDemo - given two projects this builds and creates a VPN tunnel between them , again building all the necessary resources.
